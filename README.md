# Building-a-Restaurant-Success-Model-Using-Yelp-Data

The datasets were generated using a combination of 2 data sources: Kaggle and a dataset created by a professor from SUNY Stony Brook.

Just executing the code files is enough to run them.

All the data preprocessing was done on University Super Computer by splitting the dataset into multiple parts and executing it parallelly and then later merging them. This was done as we are dealing with big data and thus processing them wasn't feasible.
